# URL Shortener
This project is a URL shortener created using TypeScript and Firebase. The URL shortener allows users to shorten long URLs and provides basic analytics for the shortened URLs.

## Features
- URL Shortening: Users can paste a long URL into the URL shortener platform, and a shorter URL will be automatically generated. The shortened URL is designed to be as short as possible for easy sharing on social media or other channels.

- Custom URLs: Users have the option to customize their shortened URLs. They can choose their own custom domain name and customize the URL to reflect their brand or content. This feature is particularly useful for individuals or small businesses who want to create branded links for their content.

- Analytics: The URL shortener provides basic analytics for the shortened URLs. Users can track the number of clicks their shortened URLs have received and see where the clicks are coming from. Firebase's built-in analytics feature is used to implement this functionality.

## Technologies Used
- TypeScript: The project is built using TypeScript, a typed superset of JavaScript that provides improved tooling and scalability.

- Firebase: Firebase is used as the backend technology for storing user data and handling authentication. It provides a scalable and reliable infrastructure for the URL shortener.
